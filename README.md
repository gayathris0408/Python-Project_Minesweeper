# Python Project - Minesweeper
## Project Overview
The aim of this project was to take an already existing code of the game, “Minesweeper” and add modifications to it. The code that we obtained implemented a basic version of the game using the Pygame library. Our objective was to add new features to the game, make its interface more attractive and in the process, learn about Python libraries like Pygame, Tkinter and Pillow.
